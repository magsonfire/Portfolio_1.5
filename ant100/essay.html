                <h2>The ANT100 Essay Assignment</h2>

                <h3>Three Milestones</h3>
                <p>The essay assignment is comprised of three parts due over the course of the year:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Part 1: Topic and Literature Proposal</li>
                    <li>Part 2: Advanced Draft Essay</li>
                    <li>Part 3: Final Essay</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each part marks a milestone in the process of writing a formal academic research paper. You will choose a specific anthropological topic to research and think about in depth, and to report your findings. Our requirements and instructions are meant to improve your academic writing skills. <b>Assignments must be submitted via TurnItIn.</b></p>

                <P>There is a lot of information on this web site that explains how to write a well thought out and well referenced essay, including the due dates for the three milstone assignments. <b>Take time to read it all!</b></p>

                <div class="text-content-alt">
                    <h3><span class="warning">Warning:</span> Don't Forget the Quiz &amp; Checklist!</h3>

                    <p>There are three things you must do before you submit the draft essay:</p> 

                    <ol>
                        <li>Pass the <a href="quiz.html" target="_blank">Plagiarism Quiz</a></li>
                        <li>Complete the <a href="checklist.html" target="_blank">Essay Checklist</a></li>
                        <li>Include both Confirmation Codes (from each task) in your assignment</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Failure to do so will result in a <a href="evaluation.html#warning"><b>grade deduction.</b></a> Expand the accordion below for assignment details.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
                
                <p>After completing the three-part essay assignment, students will be able to:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Distinguish peer-reviewed journal articles from popular sources and select a peer-
                        reviewed source to support one of the four assigned essay topics.</li>

                        <li>Identify the various types of evidence used within anthropology, evaluate such evidence, and employ this evaluation to develop and defend a position on a given essay topic.</li>

                        <li>Understand and apply the steps of the writing process to create a well-structured essay, including being able to incorporate feedback from the essay assignment to revise the essay.</li>

                        <li>Write a university-level anthropology essay, including constructing a thesis statement and developing an argument to evaluate an assigned topic.</li>
                    </ol>


                <h3>Draft vs. Final Essay</h3>

                <p>As you can see below, the process for both the draft and final essay are quite similar. Remember that there are two separate due dates, and that your final essay <b>must include revisions</b> that reflect your TA's feedback on your draft essay. For details on how your revision of the essay will be evaluated, please see the Evaluation &amp; Extensions page.</p>

                <h3>Late Submission &amp; Penalties</h3>

                <p>For information about course policies regarding late submission and penalties, please see the link below.</p>

                    <h4>Popular Articles</h4>

                    <p>Read the popular articles to give you a sense of the arguments involved in the different topics. The popular articles are to get you started, but <b>are not</b> to be used in your essay proposal.</p>

                    <h4>Scholarly Articles</h4>

                    <p>Each question also provides required scholarly reading(s) (evolutionary anthropology has two required peer reviewed articles). Carefully read and reread the provided reading(s), as you will be rquired to use it in your proposal.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>This is the hardest part for most students. Evidence is a fact or facts that support your main point, which we asked you to describe above. Facts include events, measurements, statistics, personal and reported experiences, and the like. Please note - this is one of the main things to learn through this exercise - that an author making a point is NOT usually evidence.</p>

                    <p>If you do not understand what we have just said here then you MUST clarify it with your TA.</p>

                    <p>All evidence you use in the essay must be referenced to the sources (which are refereed works). For the Proposal, we are asking you to refer only to evidence from the required and additional sources that you chose. However, in the actual essay you may use and reference evidence from other sources as well.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <h4>Length</h4>
                        <li>1,500 words maximum (or about 6 double-spaced pages) excluding the Reference List.  Go by word count, not page count and do word counts as you write (most word processors do this.)</li>
                        <li>Over 1,500 words may result in a 10% grade penalty.</li></p>

                    <h4>Required Page Elements</h4>
                        <li>No title page</li>
                        <li><b>Top of first page:</b> List your name (given name, then family name), student number, title of the essay, the date you actually submit the paper, and your confirmation codes for the plagiarism quiz and essay checklist</li>
                        <li>12-point Times, Times New Roman or Arial typeface</li>
                        <li>At least 2.5cm margins all around</li>
                        <li>Double-space throughout</li>
                        <li>Number all pages</li></p>

                    <h4>No Quotations</h4>

                        <p>The only exception is when you are commenting in your paper on an author's wording of a text passage. In that case you may use a quote, but only with your TA's prior approval. Each unauthorized use of a quotation will result in an automatic, non-negotiable deduction of 10% of your total essay mark (i.e. the mark that includes all three parts of the assignment). Worse yet, if you quote a passage without putting quotation marks around it then you will be charged with plagiarism, even if you follow the passage with a citation.</p>

                    <h4>Be Wary of Paraphrasing</h4>
                        <p>In many cases, paraphrasing is <a href="plagiarism.html">plagiarism</a>, and should be carefully avoided. Never copy any part of a text into your paper, even if you then put your own words around or in the copied patch. This is called "disguised copying" and it is the most common type of plagiarism. It is no excuse if you follow your "disguised-copied" text with a reference to where you copied it from.</p>

                    <h4>Other Stipulations</h4>
                        <b>
                        <li>No Illustrations</li>
                        <li>No Footnotes or Endnotes</li></b>
